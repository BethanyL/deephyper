"""
Deephyper is a Python package which provides a common interface for the implementation and study of scalable hyperparameter search methods. In this package we provide to the user different modules:
    - ``benchmarks``: a set of problems for hyperparameter search which the user can use to compare our different search algorithms or as examples to build their own problems.
    - ``evaluators``: a set of objects which help to run search on different systems and for different cases such as quick and light experiments or long and heavy runs.
    - ``search``: a set of algorithms for hyperparameter search. You will also find a modular way to define new search algorithms.
